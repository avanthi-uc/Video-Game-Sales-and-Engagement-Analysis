# Video-Game-Sales-and-Engagement-Analysis
By merging sales and engagement data, we seek to offer insights into how game features, platforms, and genres influence sales, wishlists, and ratings. SQL will be used to structure and store the data, while Power BI/Streamlit dashboards will be developed to guide decision-making for game developers, marketers, and publishers.
